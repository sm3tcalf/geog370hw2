    <p>This map depicts the areas within the city of Denver that are within a quarter-mile of a bus stop, and which are outside of that quarter-mile boundary. I used the buffer tool on a shapefile of all the bus stops in Denver to get a layer that had the quarter-mile distances from every bus stop in the metro area. Then, I used the difference tool with a shapefile of the neighborhoods of Denver so that the final layer only included these quarter-mile buffers within the city proper.</p>
