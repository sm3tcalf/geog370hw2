    <p>For the final assessment in the course, we were tasked with making a map that represents the rural and urban counties more than 10 miles from a hospital using a provided shapefile (of North Carolina counties), a shapefile of all of the hospitals in North Carolina, and a .csv file of each of those counties with population density statistics. This map is intended to illustrate the lack of adequate healthcare options for people in rural counties who have to travel further to get treatment.</p>
