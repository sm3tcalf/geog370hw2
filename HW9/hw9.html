    <h1>Homework 9</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>For this homework, we were tasked with using satellite data in Google Earth Engine along with geoprocessing tools to create a map of our interest in a particular city or county. I chose to do mine on my hometown of Denver, Colorado. This map uses shading to analyze the distance to a bus stop from everywhere in the city. The map and code used to produce the map in Google Earth Engine can be found
