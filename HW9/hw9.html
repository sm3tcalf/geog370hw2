    <p>This map portrays the percentage of the population in each Colorado county that is elligible for government-provided health insurance, but is still unenrolled. I was wanted to visualize this data because I wanted to see whether or not there was a correlation in the uninsured rate between richer counties (such as Denver county, the southern suburbs, and mountain counties) relative to poorer, more rural counties. Surprisingly, while Denver and the southern suburbs had lower uninsured rates, many of the monutain counties had some of the highest uninsured rates in the state.</p>
